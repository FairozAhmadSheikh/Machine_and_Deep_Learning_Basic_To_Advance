    "# Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates the use of various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to build a model capable of detecting DDoS attacks in network traffic. The goal is to classify network flows as either benign or DDoS attack traffic based on extracted flow-level features.\n",

    "We use  CICDDoS2019 dataset and for upcoming work we will combine CICDDOS2019 and  UL-ECE-DDoS-H-IoT-Datasets2025, allowing the model to learn both traditional enterprise network behavior and IoT healthcare network attack patterns."
